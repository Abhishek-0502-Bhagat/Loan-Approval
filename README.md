# Loan-Approval

This project focuses on analyzing and predicting loan approval status based on various customer features using Python and data analysis techniques. The dataset includes attributes such as applicant income, education, loan amount, credit history, and more. The objective is to uncover key patterns and insights that influence whether a loan is approved or rejected.

Data Cleaning & Preprocessing: Handled missing values and converted categorical variables into numerical form for analysis.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualized data distributions and relationships using bar charts, pie charts, and box plots.

Correlation Analysis: Heatmaps were used to identify significant relationships between features and the loan approval status.

Insights:-
Applicants with higher credit history and income tend to have their loans approved.

Education, property area, and self-employment status also play a role in approval decisions.

Data visualization helped uncover these patterns effectively.
